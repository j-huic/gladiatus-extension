# Gladiatus Helper

A small local Chrome extension that adds a sort bar/scanner popup to the Gladiatus auction house and a basic opponent scanner for arena pages.

It reads the visible auction item tooltip data from `data-tooltip`, parses stat lines such as `Strength +11% (+5)` or `Damage 50 - 62`, and reorders the current auction page in the browser. It works across auction item types because the parser reads the item tooltip data for each visible listing instead of assuming weapons, shields, helmets, or any other category.

It does not bid, buy, attack, call non-game APIs, or send data anywhere. The popup scanner only requests Gladiatus pages using the active browser session and caches auction scans in local extension storage.

## Load In Chrome

1. Open `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable `Developer mode`.
3. Click `Load unpacked`.
4. Select this folder: `/Users/jankohuic/dev/gladiatus`.
5. Open the Gladiatus auction house and use the injected `Auction sorter` bar, or open the extension popup and click `Scan auction`.
6. Open a Gladiatus arena opponent list and use the popup `Scan opponents` button to fetch visible opponent profiles and annotate their rows with primary stat totals.

## Notes

- Open the extension popup on an auction page and click `Scan auction` to fetch all auction categories with your current name, minimum-level, and quality filters.
- Open the extension popup on an arena page and click `Scan opponents` to fetch the visible opponent profiles, sum their six primary stats, and show the score next to each arena row.
- Arena profile fetching is handled by the extension background worker because opponents may be on another Gladiatus province/subdomain.
- The scanner attempts both auction groups from one button by using the auction-page links for Gladiator necessities and Mercenary necessities.
- A successful auction scan replaces the current cached item list. The previous scan is compacted into a bounded local archive in extension storage for later debugging/comparison.
- The popup has `Items` and `Filters` pages. Use `Filters` to create custom score filters without writing formulas.
- Popup tabs group results into Weapons, Armor, Food, Upgrades, and Mercenaries. Each tab keeps its own selected sort preset.
- Popup tab and preset clicks also apply the same sort to the visible auction page when the active tab is a Gladiatus auction page.
- Popup item rows show thumbnails when the game exposes an image URL or inline icon background style in the auction markup.
- Default popup sorting is average weapon damage, food healing per gold, armor main-character score, upgrade damage, and mercenary agility.
- The in-page auction sorter uses those same defaults for each auction item type, then remembers manual sort changes per item type.
- The in-page sort dropdown only shows preset scores for the current item group; generic stat and field sorts remain available everywhere.
- Enabled custom filters are saved in `chrome.storage.local` under `glad-ah-custom-definitions-v1` and appear as group-specific custom score presets.
- Popup and in-page filter values are shared in `chrome.storage.local` under `glad-ah-filter-values-v1`.
- Armor has a configurable `Min bonus damage` filter. It defaults to `0`, so it only filters once raised.
- Armor main-character score is `agility + dexterity + ((damage bonus + strength / 10) * 8)`.
- Sorting affects only the currently visible auction page.
- Use the game filter first for item type, level, and quality, then sort the visible results by Strength, Dexterity, Agility, Constitution, Charisma, Intelligence, Life points, Health, Armour, Damage bonus, weapon damage, Block value, Healing, and related values.
- `High first` is the default for stats. `Immediate gold` defaults to low first.
- The selected sort stat and sort direction are persisted across auction filter reloads.
- If you change files while the extension is already loaded, click the extension reload button on `chrome://extensions`, then refresh the Gladiatus page.

## DevTools API

The shared schema and scanner/parser are exposed on the auction page as:

```js
window.GladiatusAuctionSchema
window.GladiatusAuctionCore
```

Useful calls:

```js
await window.GladiatusAuctionCore.scanAllAuctionItems()
window.GladiatusAuctionCore.parseStats(["Healing +87,+11", "Intelligence +21"])
```

The popup uses the same page-level API through a content-script bridge. The schema owns stat keys, display labels, stable auction category ids, and storage keys. The core API is loaded in Chrome's MAIN world so DevTools and the extension exercise the same parser and scanner code. The scan API first tries normal page fetches and falls back to hidden same-origin iframe/form loads when fetches are blocked.

## Architecture Checks

```sh
for file in auction-schema.js score-model.js auction-core.js auction-model.js auction-content.js arena-core.js arena-content.js background.js popup.js popup/*.js architecture.test.js; do node --check "$file"; done
node architecture.test.js
```

## Adding Presets And Filters

Auction groups, score formulas, and filters are isolated in `auction-model.js`. Stable stat/category/storage contracts are isolated in `auction-schema.js`. The popup and auction content script consume those definitions instead of duplicating formulas.

Custom filters created in the popup use this shape:

```js
{
  id: "armor-dps",
  name: "Armor DPS",
  appliesTo: ["armor"],
  terms: [
    { stat: "agility", weight: 1 },
    { stat: "dexterity", weight: 1 },
    { stat: "damageBonus", weight: 10 }
  ],
  constraints: [
    { stat: "damageBonus", op: ">=", value: 6 }
  ],
  enabled: true
}
```

The score is the sum of each stat multiplied by its weight. Constraints support `>=` and `<=`; all constraints must pass for an item to remain visible when that custom preset is selected.

To add a numeric minimum filter to a group, add it to that view:

```js
filters: [
  defineMinimumStatFilter({
    id: "minDamageBonus",
    label: "Min bonus damage",
    statKey: "damageBonus"
  })
]
```

Score presets use the same pattern:

```js
defineScorePreset({
  id: "main",
  label: "Main: Agi/Dex + dmg x8",
  score: mainCharacterScore
})
```

## Parsed Tooltip Formats

- Equippable weapons: `Damage 56 - 71` and compound durability lines like `Damage 56 - 71,+7 - 9`; the base range before the comma is used for sorting.
- Non-weapon equipment: flat damage lines like `Damage +7`, `Damage +5,0`, and `Damage +8,+1`; the base value before the comma is used for sorting.
- Upgrades: usage lines like `Using: +10 Damage` or `Using: +6 Charisma`.
- Food: usage lines like `Using: Heals 798 of life`; only the first healed-life number is counted, so intelligence/vitality breakdown numbers in the same sentence are ignored.
- Mercenary contracts: absolute stat lines like `Life points: 2130` and `Strength: 98`.
- Mercenary equipment: regular equipment stats plus fields like `Threat`, `Block value`, `Healing`, and critical values.
